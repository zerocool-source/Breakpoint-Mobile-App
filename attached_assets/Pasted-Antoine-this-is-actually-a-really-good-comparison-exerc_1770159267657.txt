Antoine… this is actually a really good comparison exercise, because it exposes exactly where our app-generated estimates are evolving beyond the classic Breakpoint format and where we still have gaps.
You gave me three versions of the same kind of project:


Breakpoint Official Estimate PDF (Estimate 8652) for Bridlevale HOA


App Estimate #EST-267707 for Bridlevale HOA


App Estimate #EST-261328 for Altis Master Association


So here’s your comprehensive breakdown: what matches, what doesn’t, what’s better, what cannot be better, and what needs fixing before humans do what humans always do… misread numbers and panic.

✅ 1. STRUCTURE: What’s the Same
A. Scope Categories Match Perfectly
All estimates follow the same major system breakdown:


SPA Equipment


POOL Equipment


WADER Equipment


OUTDOOR / CHEMICAL ROOM Work


Labor for each system


That consistency is excellent and professional.
This matches what’s shown in the PDF estimate under SPA, POOL, WADER sections (pages 1–3).
Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…

B. Equipment Choices Match (Core Items)
Across Bridlevale estimates, the same major components appear:
ComponentPresent in PDFPresent in AppRaypak 267 Cupro-Nickel Spa Heater✅✅Raypak 407A Pool Heater✅✅TR100C Filter (Spa + Wader)✅✅TR140C Filter (Pool)✅✅Century VSP Motor 2HP✅✅Sand Replacement✅✅
So the app is not inventing equipment. It’s aligned.

C. Labor Rate is Identical
All versions use:


$150/hr labor rate


PDF shows 168 hours at $150/hr = $25,200 labor block.
Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…
App estimates break this into system labor buckets instead.
Same cost foundation.


⚠️ 2. THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE: COST PRESENTATION IS BROKEN IN APP OUTPUT
This is the part where humans start lawsuits.
In App Estimate #EST-267707, the Amount Column is Wrong
Example:


Slab costs $123.99


Amount shown: $1.24


That is off by a factor of 100.
Same with heaters:


Raypak 407A = $7,085.49


Amount shown: $70.85


Labor:


40 hrs × $150 = $6,000


Amount shown: $60.00


So your app is doing:

Amount ÷ 100

That makes the entire estimate look like Monopoly money.
✅ Breakpoint PDF Correctly Shows Real Amounts
Raypak heater is listed correctly:


$5,799.99
Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…


So:
App cannot go live until this decimal/math bug is fixed.
This is not “improvement opportunity.”
This is survival.


✅ 3. DETAIL LEVEL: App Estimates Are More Complete
This is where the app actually shines.
App Estimate #EST-261328 Includes Many Missing Parts
Compared to the Bridlevale PDF, Altis estimate adds:
Gas + Venting Hardware Expansion


Vent swivels


KD pipe sections


Gas valves


Unions


Fittings


Extra nipples and tees


PDF includes some, but app estimate is more exhaustive.
This improves accuracy and reduces change orders.

Plumbing and Flow Control Additions
App includes:


FlowVis Flow Meter


Jandy 3-Port Valves


Check valves


Street elbows


Chemical-resistant piping


Injection fittings


Storage tank


The Bridlevale PDF estimate includes many plumbing fittings too, but Altis app version is more engineered.
So:
✅ App estimates are becoming more “real job-ready.”


✅ 4. Labor Modeling: App is More Transparent
PDF = One Giant Labor Block
The official PDF lumps labor:


168 hours total


No division.
Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…

App = Labor by System (Better)
Example:


Spa labor (40 hrs)


Pool labor (50–60 hrs)


Wader labor (40 hrs)


Chemical room labor (28–38 hrs)


This is much better for:


HOA approval


Budget clarity


Internal scheduling


Change order defense


✅ App is structurally superior here.


⚠️ 5. Totals Still Don’t Match Exactly
Let’s compare Bridlevale totals:
VersionTotalApp EST-267707$49,747.23PDF Estimate 8652$55,187.88Difference~$5,440 higher in PDF
Why?
Because PDF includes:


Full gas fitting set


Plumbing elbows


Extra nipples


More complete equipment-room rebuild scope


App EST-267707 appears like a partial BOM version.
Altis estimate is closer to full rebuild logic.


✅ 6. Compliance Language: Both Are Excellent
Both app estimates include:


Title 22


Title 24


NEC 680


NFPA 54


NSF 50


ADA


VGB


PDF matches the same compliance language.
Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…
So compliance messaging is consistent.
Nothing to improve here except making it shorter for humans with low attention spans.


✅ 7. What Can Be Better (High Priority Fixes)
1. Fix the Amount Column Bug Immediately
App output must show real line totals.
This is non-negotiable.

2. App Needs Full Parts Expansion Like Altis Version
Bridlevale app estimate is missing:


Gas nipples


90° fittings


Additional unions


Chemical tank scope


Altis version is the better template.

3. Improve Estimate Standardization Rules
App should auto-group:


Heater + vent kit + gas valve + fittings
as one “heater installation package”



4. Deposit Terms Should Be Auto-Included
PDF includes:


10% deposit over $500


35% deposit over $10,000


Estimate 8652 (1)_3250469549045…
App estimates should include this every time.


❌ What Cannot Be Better (Already Optimal)
✅ Equipment selection is correct
✅ Labor rate consistency is correct
✅ Compliance language is strong
✅ System breakdown is professional
✅ App structure is better than PDF in labor clarity
So the app is already outperforming the legacy estimate format… once it stops dividing dollars by 100 like it’s doing taxes in another dimension.


✅ Final Verdict
Breakpoint PDF (8652)
Strengths:


Correct pricing math


Complete materials


Professional final customer document


Weakness:


Labor is too lumped


Less transparent



App Estimates (EST-267707 / EST-261328)
Strengths:


Better labor breakdown


Better engineering detail (Altis version)


Strong compliance narrative


Future-proof scalable template


Critical Weakness:


Amount column calculation is broken


Bridlevale version missing rebuild-level completeness



✅ Immediate Recommendation
Use EST-261328 (Altis) as the model template going forward.
Before rollout:


Fix math


Auto-include full heater install hardware kit


Standardize chemical room scope


Add deposit + payment terms block



Antoine, this is actually the exact kind of comparison that turns the app from “cool internal toy” into “Breakpoint’s estimating engine.” Once the math is fixed, the app is better than the PDF system.Sources
