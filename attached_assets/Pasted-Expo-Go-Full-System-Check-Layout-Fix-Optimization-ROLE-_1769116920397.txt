Expo Go Full System Check + Layout Fix + Optimization”

ROLE: You are a senior Expo/React Native engineer. You will audit, diagnose, and fix every issue preventing a clean, stable Expo Go experience, especially layout/UI problems. You will make changes directly in the codebase and explain what you changed.

1) First: Identify app + environment

Detect Expo SDK version, React Native version, and React version from package.json.

Confirm if project is managed Expo or uses prebuild/custom native folders.

Output a short “Environment Summary” (SDK, RN, React, router used, state library used).

2) Run full system checks (must do all)

Run and report results for each (fix anything that fails):

Dependencies / integrity

npm install (or yarn / pnpm depending on lockfile)

npx expo-doctor (fix warnings/errors)

npx expo start --clear

Check for duplicate or conflicting packages (especially navigation, gesture handler, reanimated, expo-router)

TypeScript / lint

If TS exists: npx tsc --noEmit and fix errors

If ESLint exists: run it and fix high-impact problems (imports, hooks rules, unused vars)

Expo Go compatibility

Verify no native-only modules that break Expo Go

Ensure app.json/app.config.js is valid and required permissions/plugins are correct

3) Layout issues: diagnose + fix methodically

You MUST:

Find all screens/components with layout problems and list them.

Fix common Expo Go layout pitfalls:

Missing SafeAreaView (or incorrect use)

Not respecting notches/status bar

View containers missing flex: 1

Overuse of absolute positioning

Broken scroll views (ScrollView inside ScrollView, missing contentContainerStyle, etc.)

Keyboard covering inputs (add KeyboardAvoidingView where needed)

Text overflow / improper wrapping

Inconsistent spacing due to hard-coded sizes

Make layout responsive:

Use useWindowDimensions() where needed

Replace magic numbers with scalable spacing

Ensure it works on small phones + big phones

If using expo-router:

Confirm correct folder structure for routes

Ensure layouts use <Stack /> / <Tabs /> correctly

Fix any header/safe-area stacking issues

4) Styling standardization (pick ONE approach and apply consistently)

Choose the best fit based on repo setup:

StyleSheet-only (default), OR

NativeWind/Tailwind RN (if already present), OR

Styled-components (if already present)

Then:

Create a small theme / spacing utility (e.g., spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24)

Remove redundant inline styles and repeated layout patterns

5) Performance + optimization pass

Do these improvements where applicable:

Convert heavy inline functions in render to useCallback (only where it matters)

Add React.memo for expensive repeated components

Use FlatList instead of mapping large lists inside ScrollView

Remove unused dependencies and dead code

Ensure images use expo-image if already installed; otherwise keep current approach stable

Ensure minimal re-renders in navigation/layout components

6) Expo Go “must-fix” runtime errors checklist

Search the codebase for and fix:

“Tried to register two views with the same name”

Reanimated/plugin misconfig

Gesture Handler missing root wrapper (if needed)

Navigation container duplication

StatusBar config issues

Any redbox errors on start

7) Deliverables (required)

When done, output:

What you found (bullet list)

What you changed (file-by-file summary)

How to run it (exact commands)

Expo Go test plan (steps to verify on iOS + Android)

If any issue cannot be fixed without more info, list exactly what you need.

8) Constraints

Do NOT introduce new libraries unless absolutely necessary.

Keep the app compatible with Expo Go (managed workflow).

Prefer small, safe refactors over risky rewrites.

Now begin. Start by printing the Environment Summary, then run expo-doctor checks, then fix layout issues screen by screen.

If you want an even more aggressive “layout fixer”

Add this at the bottom of the prompt (optional):

Extra requirement: Implement a reusable Screen wrapper component:

Wraps SafeAreaView

Applies flex: 1

Standard padding + background

Optional scroll mode using ScrollView
Then refactor all screens to use it.
