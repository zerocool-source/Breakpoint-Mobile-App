Goal: Wire the “Repairs Needed” modal to POST to the admin backend at POST /api/tech-ops so submissions appear in Admin → Tech Ops Alerts.

Context:
- Base URL comes from process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL via getApiUrl() in client/lib/query-client.ts
- Mobile API key is in process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MOBILE_API_KEY and must be sent as header: X-MOBILE-KEY
- Endpoint expects JSON with:
  entryType: "repairs_needed"
  description: string (min 10 chars)
  priority: "urgent" | "normal"
  propertyId, propertyName, bodyOfWater, technicianId, technicianName (all required for our workflow)
  photos optional (array/urls if present)

Edits:
1) In client/lib/query-client.ts, add a new helper:
   export async function mobileKeyRequest(route: string, data: unknown): Promise<Response>
   - baseUrl = getApiUrl()
   - url = joinUrl(baseUrl, route)
   - read const mobileKey = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_MOBILE_API_KEY
   - headers must include:
     Content-Type: application/json
     X-MOBILE-KEY: <mobileKey>
   - do NOT attach Authorization token
   - fetch POST and call throwIfResNotOk(res)
   - return res

2) Find the Repairs Needed modal/screen (the UI that shows “Submit Repair Request”).
   - Replace the current placeholder submit handler so it:
     a) validates description length >= 10
     b) maps “Mark as Urgent” checkbox to priority ("urgent" if checked else "normal")
     c) gathers required fields:
        propertyId/propertyName/bodyOfWater from the current selected stop/context
        technicianId/technicianName from current logged-in user
     d) calls:
        await mobileKeyRequest("/api/tech-ops", payload)
     e) on success: clear the form, close modal, and show a simple success alert/toast
     f) on error: show the server error text (status + body) so we can debug quickly

3) Add a small debug log in DEV:
   console.log("[RepairsNeeded] POST", url, payloadWithoutKey)
   but never log the API key.

4) Ensure the route is exactly "/api/tech-ops" and entryType is exactly "repairs_needed".

Return: implement changes and point me to the files edited and the exact lines where submit is wired up.
