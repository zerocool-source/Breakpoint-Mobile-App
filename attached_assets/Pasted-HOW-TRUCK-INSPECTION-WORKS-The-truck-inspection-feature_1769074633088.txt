Multiple truck views - Front, Back, Driver Side, Passenger Side

Damage type classification - Different colors for different damage types:

🔴 D (Dented) - Red
🟠 S (Scratched) - Orange
🔵 C (Cracked Glass) - Cyan/Blue
🟣 M (Missing Parts) - Purple
⚫ R (Rusty) - Gray
🟡 O (Other) - Yellow
Tire condition tracking - Record tire status for all 4 wheels

Checklist items - Standard inspection checklist

PDF generation - Generate inspection reports as PDFs

Email/sharing - Send reports via email
