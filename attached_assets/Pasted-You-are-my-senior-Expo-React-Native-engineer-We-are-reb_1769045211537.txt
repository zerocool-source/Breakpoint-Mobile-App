You are my senior Expo/React Native engineer. We are rebuilding our Breakpoint Commercial Pool Systems mobile app as a proper Expo app so we can generate an Android Developer Build (APK) using EAS from inside Replit.

GOAL:
- Build a mobile-first app in Expo (React Native + TypeScript)
- Use NativeWind for Tailwind-style classes (NOT web Tailwind)
- Use React Navigation (NOT Wouter)
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Use an Express + TypeScript backend with PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (separate service)
- Ensure the Expo app is EAS-ready and can build an Android development client APK.
- Apply brand colors:
  - Azure Blue: #0078D4 (primary)
  - Vivid Tangerine: #FF8000 (accent)
  - Tropical Teal: #17BEBB
  - Emerald: #22D69A

IMPORTANT RULES:
- You MUST be step-by-step. After each step, STOP and ask me to run/confirm the commands and paste output.
- Do not use Vite. Do not use Wouter. Do not use @dnd-kit. This is React Native.
- Use react-native-draggable-flatlist for reorder lists.
- Use expo-image-picker for photos.
- Use react-native-toast-message for toasts.
- Use @react-native-community/netinfo + AsyncStorage for offline queue basics.
- Keep components simple, reusable, and mobile-first.

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP (MOBILE)
Step 1: Create the Expo app (TypeScript).
- Provide the exact commands to run in Replit shell.
- Confirm the app runs with `npx expo start`.

Step 2: Install and configure navigation.
- Install @react-navigation/native, native-stack, bottom-tabs
- Install required Expo dependencies (react-native-screens, safe-area-context, etc.)
- Create navigation structure:
  - AuthStack: SplashScreen (2s), LoginScreen
  - AppTabs: RepairTechTabs (Home, Queue, Estimates, Jobs, Profile)
- Add a basic placeholder screen for each tab.

Step 3: Install NativeWind and set up styling tokens.
- Install nativewind + tailwindcss
- Configure babel + tailwind.config
- Add theme tokens for Breakpoint colors
- Create a `theme.ts` exporting colors & spacing tokens.
- Build 1 reusable component: <BPButton> with variants (primary/secondary/danger)

Step 4: Install TanStack Query and set up API client.
- Install @tanstack/react-query
- Create QueryClient provider at root
- Create `api.ts` with axios (or fetch) baseURL = ENV var
- Create `env.ts` for API_BASE_URL (use Expo config / app.config)

Step 5: EAS DEV BUILD readiness
- Install expo-dev-client
- Run `eas login`
- Run `eas build:configure`
- Create `eas.json` with profiles: development + production
- Ensure development profile uses developmentClient: true
- Provide the exact command to create Android dev APK:
  `eas build --platform android --profile development`
- STOP and ask me to paste the output/errors.

PHASE 1: PROJECT SETUP (BACKEND API) – SEPARATE SERVICE
Step 6: Create Express + TypeScript + Drizzle + PostgreSQL backend (separate folder or separate Replit).
- Provide exact commands to scaffold.
- Set up DB connection + Drizzle.
- Create tables:
  Users (id, name, email, passwordHash, role: service_tech/repair_tech)
  Properties (id, name, address, type, gateCode, contactName, contactPhone, notes, poolCount)
  RouteStops (id, propertyId, technicianId, scheduledTime, order, completed)
  FieldEntries (id, propertyId, technicianId, type, notes, photos, createdAt)
  Estimates (id, estimateNumber, propertyId, technicianId, status, total, items, createdAt)
  RepairJobs (id, propertyId, title, description, priority, status, photos)

Step 7: Create minimal API endpoints:
- POST /auth/login (email/password) returns JWT + user role
- GET /me returns user
- GET /properties
- GET /route-stops/today
- GET /jobs/today
- POST /field-entries
- POST /estimates
- PATCH /jobs/:id

Step 8: Connect mobile app to backend:
- Add login flow in mobile app
- Store token securely (SecureStore if possible; fallback AsyncStorage)
- Add a simple Home screen fetch:
  - greeting + user name
  - “Next Stop” card from route-stops
  - “Today’s Jobs” list from jobs with drag reorder
- STOP and ask me to confirm it works.

PHASE 2: REPAIR TECH UI (MATCH OR BETTER)
Step 9: Implement the Repair Tech screens one by one, matching these requirements:
- Splash screen with logo animation (2 seconds)
- Login screen username/password
- Bottom tabs: Home, Queue, Estimates, Jobs, Profile
- Azure Blue headers
- Desktop preview device-frame container 390x844 while keeping full-screen on mobile

Home Screen:
- Greeting + name + avatar + chat button
- Next Stop card (property name/address/type badge/pool count)
- Quick actions: Emergency (red), New Estimate (green), Order Parts (orange), Report Issue (red)
- Today’s Jobs list with drag reorder using react-native-draggable-flatlist
- Each card: handle, number, property name, time, address, pool count

Report Issue Modal:
- Property dropdown
- Issue type dropdown
- Description
- Priority: Low/Normal/High/Urgent
- Photo upload (expo-image-picker)
- Validation + submit

Queue Screen:
- 2x2 metric cards (My Estimates, Urgent Jobs, Parts Ordered, Completed)
- clicking card scrolls to section
- collapsible sections
- priority filter dropdown
- job cards with status badges

Estimates:
- list screen + detail screen
- create estimate screen with auto-number format EST-YYMM-####
- line items table: add line, product search modal, qty/rate/amount
- subtotal/tax/total
- send estimate + save draft

Chat:
- orange floating button on major screens
- full screen modal with mock history

PHASE 3: SERVICE TECH UI
Step 10: Implement Service Tech screens:
- Splash screen
- phone login (mock or real)
- tabs: Home, Truck, Profile
- purple theme (#4169E1)
- drag reorder for today’s route
- property screen with timer + checklists
- pool screen with service type grid
- voice entry screen with mic + transcription
- modals: chemical order, drop-off, repairs needed, service repairs, windy cleanup, emergency

PHASE 4: SHARED FEATURES
Step 11:
- Offline banner using NetInfo
- Cache with AsyncStorage (or SQLite) and queue actions
- Toast notifications system
- Photo capture & preview
- Animations (Reanimated) for transitions, modals, pulses

DELIVERY:
- Create the folder structure, code files, and configs.
- Provide every command I need to run.
- After each step, STOP and ask me to run the commands and paste results before continuing.
