You are working in the Breakpoint Mobile App (React / React Native / Expo + Apollo Client).

Your task is to fix three known integration issues between the mobile app and API v2.
Do NOT refactor unrelated code. Do NOT change backend behavior.

--------------------------------
STEP 1 — Fix API base URL joining
--------------------------------

Problem:
Some requests are being made to:
https://breakpoint-api-v2.onrender.comapi/auth/me

Root cause:
The base API URL is missing a trailing slash OR endpoints are missing a leading slash.

Action:
- Locate the API base URL definition (likely api.ts, client.ts, or env config)
- Ensure:
  - baseURL ends with '/'
  - all endpoint paths begin WITHOUT duplicating '/'
- Resulting calls must look like:
  https://breakpoint-api-v2.onrender.com/api/auth/me

Add a small helper if needed:
  joinUrl(base, path)

--------------------------------
STEP 2 — Unwrap paginated responses
--------------------------------

Problem:
Core list endpoints now return:
{
  items: [...],
  nextCursor: string | null
}

But mobile screens still assume arrays directly, causing:
- apiAssignments.filter is not a function
- crashes in ServiceTechHomeScreen

Action:
- Update all fetch/query handlers for:
  - assignments
  - properties
  - technicians
- Unwrap responses consistently:

  const items = response.items ?? response

- Ensure ALL screens receive arrays before calling:
  .map()
  .filter()
  .length

Do NOT change backend response shape.

--------------------------------
STEP 3 — Apollo Client typePolicies (recommended)
--------------------------------

Problem:
Apollo cache warnings + unstable merges for paginated lists.

Action:
In Apollo Client setup:
- Add typePolicies for paginated collections:
  - assignments
  - properties
  - technicians

Example pattern:
{
  Query: {
    fields: {
      assignments: {
        keyArgs: false,
        merge(existing = { items: [] }, incoming) {
          return {
            items: [...existing.items, ...incoming.items],
            nextCursor: incoming.nextCursor
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Do not over-engineer. Keep it predictable.

--------------------------------
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
--------------------------------

- No more "filter is not a function"
- /api/auth/me loads correctly
- ServiceTechHomeScreen renders even with partial data
- No crashes from missing property or assignment fields
- Apollo warnings reduced or eliminated

Output:
- List files changed
- Brief summary of each fix
